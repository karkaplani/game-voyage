## To be Fixed

There's one bug exist in the game so far, which is that every time the game is over and started again, the number of enemies to be respawned becomes double of the round before. Also, the start and game over UI of the game is not appealing, and will be made better by using more of a space-game style design as well as adding an instruction to play the game.
