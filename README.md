# Game Voyage
Hi Player1 and welcome to the Game Voyage repository! Here can be found 6 projects and their documentation of the GM (Apo) throughout his couple of months of voyage floating in the Game Development industry. 

## Background
One of the push factors that I got into Software Development industry was to have a world that I have the full control over, in other words to be the god of my world. Also, as a person who wanted to be a movie/documentary director in his childhood dreams, and considering the games are also offering a similar experience, being a game producer and create my own indie game soon occurred as my new dream. 

Even while I was learning just the fundamentals of programming, I always had in mind that how could I apply that knowledge to games. Indeed, my first personal project was an interactive story right after learning variables and if-else (: Several months later, I had finally started working seriously on game development with text-based games on Java. When I felt ready I started learning how to create a visual games. From there, I used different technologies, and after few months, in parallel to the debut of my last term in college I have decided to put my dream on-hold for achieving it via an indirect and realistic way, focusing more on mastering UX design through Web Development. I won't forget the hours I spent in the "zone" while developing those games, and will come back again!
