# Ad Rosa
Bizzaro casual Desktop game made in Unity3D. It offers a very simple gameplay with gradually increasing difficulty. The game was an experimental project and intended to be disturbing, so it's a nice game for whom like surfing around the materials like the weird side of YouTube. In this repository, like the Astero Slayer II's, only the C# scripts are included.

## Outcomes
- Made an exposure to 3D game development
- Simple modeling done in Paint3D
- Created a special user experience using psychology knowledge
