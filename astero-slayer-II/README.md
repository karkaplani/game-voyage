# Astero Slayer II
Arcade Shoot 'Em Up style game made for desktop PC using Unity and C#. At first, it was planned to make a casual, Flappy Bird style game with one extra mechanic, which is shooting, just to get familiarized with Unity. Then, one extra idea led to another, and this came up. The repository includes merely the C# scripts written for the game.

## Outcomes
- Gotten a strong grasp in Unity's interface
- Learned C# as well as its libraries used for Unity games
- Practiced managing sound effects, animations and game flow
- Designed UI for several areas in the game
- Implemented various game mechanics
- Tested via GM options and debugged

## Further

Asides from adding more levels, the gameplay experience can be improved more by increasing the in-level difficulty through adding different enemy types, playing around with the stats and give user different kinds of abilities (skills) for allowing user to showcase more skills. As the game was designed to be in arcade style, there's no story needed.
