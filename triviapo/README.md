# Triviapo

Trivia application made for the Mobile GUI Development class as the part of the final group project (Resulted in straight A+ grade). The user is given the options to choose the question type and difficulty as well as the number of questions and the questions are generated accordingly. The user's score is tracked and saved to an SQLite database for the scoreboard. Only the files I created included in this repository.

## Outcomes

- Designed a legit-looking interface using XML
- Written the application using Kotlin (self-taught)
- Worked with a JSON API using Asynchronous Programming 
- Made a database connection with create, delete and read functionalities
- Different design patterns applied such as Adapter and Facade
- Provided a Turkish localized version of the application
- Collaborated with a team in the merging process

## Further

The app was made to met all the requirements of the project, so there might be some things does not make sense from the perspective of the user, like choosing the number of questions. Also the app can be improved much more by adding time limit, question categories and images etc.
